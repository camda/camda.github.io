    So many people all around the world.Tell me where do I find someone like you girl.

## 英文

Hiding from the rain and snow   

    避开风雪

Trying to forget but I won't let go

    想要忘记，但又不愿放手

Looking at crowded street

    注视拥挤的街道

Listening to my own heart beat

    聆听自己的心跳

So many people all around the world

    世界上那么多人

Tell me where do I find someone like you girl

    在哪里才能找到像你这样的女孩

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

    把我带进你的心灵

Give me your hand before I'm old

    让我握你的手，拥抱我

Show me what love is-haven't got a clue

    告诉我爱的真谛，我还对爱毫无概念

Show me that wonder can be true

    

They say nothing lasts forever

We're only here today

Love is now or never

Bring me far away

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand and hold me 

Show me what's love is-be my guiding star

It's easy take me to your heart

Standing on a mountain hign

Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky

I should go and see some friends

But they don't really comprehend

Don't need too much talking without say anything 

All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand before I'm old

Show me what love is-haven't got clue

Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever

We're only here today

Love is now or never

Bring me far away

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand and hold me

Show me what love is-be my guiding star

It's easy take me to your heart

Take me to your heart take me to your soul

Give me your hand and hold me 

Show me what love is-be my guiding star

It's easy take me to your heart
